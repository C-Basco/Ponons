# Ponos
## Overview
Ponos is a simple project management application. Create task, set deadlines and add members if you choose.
This project is a an updated version of a task management application built with Django that you can find here: https://gitlab.com/C-Basco/Task-Tracker

In this version I've updated features and used a different framework. Here are some key changes:
  - Used Docker to build my web application
  - Built the frontend with Bootstrap and React.
  - Backend was built using FastAPI.
  - Used PostgresSQL as my database and designed database schemas to facilitate user data.
